This is a simple addon to toggle the status of the Kodi (XBMC) addon for boblight (http://code.google.com/p/boblight/).

You can run the script by placing something like this in your keymap file:

```xml
    <eject>RunAddon(script.toggleboblight)</eject>
```

I trigger this to enable/disable Boblight when the power button of my universal remote is pressed.
